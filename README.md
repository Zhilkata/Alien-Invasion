# Alien-Invasion
This is my first Python project, and it'll be a space shooter videogame, largely made with the help of Python Crash Course, 2nd edition.

Arcady in nature, it features a player ship with limited lives that battles against increasingly-tough fleet of invading aliens.

The fleet moves just like old-school match-them-up games and the original Space Invasion title.
The player has limited amount of bullets at a time, and his task is to take down as many aliens as possible before dying.

There's a high-score system that remembers your best result, so you can replay and try to improve it.
